AE:
    The network overfits if using fc layers in the middle. With early stopping the error is bearable - it outputs mean face over the dataset
        0.9 dropout only makes the results more terrible

    If using batchnorm/slim.batchnorm - everything breaks

    On the celeba dataset the behaviour is similar, test it again.


VAE:
    Removing fc decoder layer helps
